                        <p>Dev was born and raised in New York City and is a Software Engineer with over 20 years of experience under his belt. I (Spandana) was born in South India and immigrated to New York City when I was 11 years old and am a Developmental Behavioral Pediatrician. We met when we were 13 years old and after over a decade of friendship, got married in 2013. Our love story is a doozy and if you want to hear the whole crazy journey, scroll down! </p>

                        <div class="paraStory">
                        <p>Since our marriage, we have travelled the world, visiting places like Wales, Scotland, Japan, France and many more. We often follow our stomachs to find the places with the best food. We also share a love of scuba diving which lead them to going to dive resort for Dev's birthday every year until in 2018, they were asked a simple question, "what are you doing here?". It was one of the divemasters who they'd just spent the day diving with. He said, "I see you coming here every year (we'd gone 5 years in a row as a tradition) and while this is great, there is so much more of the world to dive. Don't waste your youth diving this over and over again!" Well that started some balls rolling in our heads and soon we started to plan a grand 2 year backpacking adventure around the world. In January 2020, we were ready to put in our 2 week notices at work and start to book flights and hotels. And then the world came crashing into a global pandemic and our plans were completely dashed. We then had a choice. We could wait till this too passed. Or we could change our dreams and plans. So we chose the latter and came up with an elaborate van life plan. We had the Transit van we wanted to remodel from scratch, the map of the US cities we wanted to visit with plans to go overseas afterwards with the van. Then we waited. And waited. And by August of 2020, the world didn't open back up. So we pivoted. Again. This time to a "future, when we're retired" dream that the youtube channel Gone With The Wynns had introduced us to two years ago. We started to do our research and in Septmeber we took our first steps onto a sailboat for our ASA 101 course and in January 2021 we started to look for a boat and bought Turtle in April of 2021, 8 months after learning how to sail. And the rest, as they say, is history. </p>

                                <p>This is a doozy, as we said. So we met in the 7th grade. I (Dev) was sitting behind Spandana in Spanish class and she turned around to offer me a piece of lemon cake and that struck an immediate friendship. We dated for a year, after which, in a shockingly dramatic manner of 14 year olds, we broke up. Spandana broke up with me in such a manner that it broke our friendship. We then ended up going to the same high school together and it took four years before I could even think about being friends with the girl who broke my heart into a thousand pieces! But we did eventually become friends again and stayed good friends, living our own lives and dating different people until 2012. After the end of a very long term relationship, I decided to move back from Jersey to Manhattan and decided to get back in touch with a lot of friends who I hadn't spoken to in years. Spandana was then a first year intern in her Pediatric residency, working over 80 hours per week. We met up for dinner and in a flash of 6 months, we were married. We got married at city hall on a Friday, with Spandana getting off a night shift from the NICU with an hour of sleep under her belt. She moved in with me on Sunday and went back to day shift at NICU on Monday. </p>
