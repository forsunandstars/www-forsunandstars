                        <p>Our boat is a 40 foot 1993 Caliber. She has a 5 foot 5 inch full integrated keel, skeg mounted rudder and has a cutter rig (although Turtle's babystay is not currently attached. Future project!). Turtle weighs in about 21 thousand pounds! Calibers, currently not operational, were built in Clearwater, Florida from 1979 to 2010. George McCreary, the co-founder of Caliber is still an active broker for the beautiful boats and can answer basically any question about their build and make up. It has an active Facbeook community. </p>

                        <p>Since we bought the boat, we have strived to make Turtle our home by adding various touches, some small and some big. </p>
                        <p class="subTitle">Power Upgrade</p>
                        <p>We upgraded Turtle to 6 100Ah Relion Lithium FePO4 batteries. We also added solar panels, both flexible and rigid totally to  970 Watts.</p> 
                        <p class="subTitle">Galley Upgrade</p> 
                        <p>We ripped out our nav station and installed new countertops and storage for our 75 liter Dometic freezer. We poured a new epoxy marble countertops and upgraded to a Kohler Neoroc composite sink.</p>
                        <p class="subTitle">Freshwater Upgrade</p>
                        <p>We installed the Seawater Pro reverse osmosis system as well ripping out the entire freshwater plumbing system in the boat and replaced it with PEX tubing and Aqualock push to connect and manifold fittings. </p>
                        <p class="subTitle">Salon upgrade</p>
                        <p>We replaced all of our cushions with brand new sunbrella cushions and installed a 27 inch monitor to the wall along with removing the fiddles on our table.</p>
                        <p class="subTitle">Berth upgrade</p>
                        <p>We replaced the forward mattress with a 4 inch firm foam topped with a 3 inch latex which in turn was topped with a 2 inch gel memory foam. This was all encased in a mattress enclosure. A laptop stand was added on the wall at the foot of the bed. Shelves were added to the hanging locker and the vanity chair was removed. A washing machine was added and secured in its place.</p>
                        <p class="subTitle">Head upgrade</p>
                        <p>The forward head toilet was replaced with a Raritan Elegance toilet with a freshwater bidet.</p>
                        <p class="subTitle">Deck upgrade</p>
                        <p>We added two Mantus BR2 bow rollers and a 33Kg Rocna anchor attached to new 300 feet of chain. </p>
