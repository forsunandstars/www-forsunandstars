                <div class="paraStory">
                <p>There are literally hundreds of medical kits out there, one for every budget and every level of training. We are not saying they are bad or inadequate but instead are making a case that something you put together yourself is going to be much better suited to you than one that someone else has built for you. Also, if you build it yourself, you will be much more comfortable opening up and practicing with some of the equipment than ones that were neatly packed by someone else. You can also control the quality of materials, the number, the cost, the size and adapt it to the type of sailing you are doing that year or for the next 6 months rather than trying to have a kit that fits all possible sailing scenarios. A final point is that some of the more extensive kits will have medication that may or may not be legal in the countries you are visiting at a certain point and if you forget that, it may cause some major headaches.  </p>

                <div class="paraStory">
                <p>The beauty of building your own med kit is that you can categorize however it makes sense for you and your team onboard and that allows you find what you need faster and pack things in ways that make sense for the space you've designated for your kit. You may organize your kit according to symptoms like “Fever” or “Motion Sickness” or you could organize it according to injury type like “Head Trauma” or “Cuts” or “Why did you eat that local salad?”. Or you could do both. The choice is yours. Go crazy with your OCD self. Below you can see an example of our own med kit and of our organization.  </p>

                    <div class="paraStory">
                        <p>Think about the next 6 months to a year at most. Where will you be? Where are you sailing? While actual sailing plans are written in sand, ever changing and disappearing, most sailors have a rough idea of whether they will be coastal, offshore or island hopping for the next 6 months to a year. Make your med kit fit that. If you will be within a day or two of land and a good hospital and medical help, your kit doesn't need to be extremely extensive. If, in 6 months, you plan on doing a huge passage, make your kit for the next 6 months and make a new, more extensive kit in 6 months for the upcoming passage. Your kit size may change because you're taking on crew or someone is getting off the boat for the next few months so your kit needs to be smaller. Don't try to have a kit that will fit every kind of sail plan and every crew size. This will keep your kit fresh and relevant. It will also force you to know your kit inside and out. </p>

                <div class="paraTitle">What Is Your Experience Level</div>
                <div class="paraStory">
                <p>We all become sailors with varying levels of expertise when it comes to medical management. Some of us know how to take a pulse and that's all we learned from Baywatch. Some of us are EMTs with 30 years of experience in the South Bronx. Build the med kit that fits your experience level. If you feel that your kit is too simple and too small, then you may want to build your experience by taking classes like CPR or wilderness medicine training courses. Too many kits contain items such as suture kits that seem like a great idea until you have to use them with little to no training or practice in the middle of rough seas and emergency conditions. When you do end up building your kit make sure you practice the use of every item and that everyone on board knows how to use your kit because you'll never know who will end up being the patient! It could be you!   </p>

                <div class="paraStory">
                <p>You can inventory in many ways. You can have an excel sheet that has pertinent information like name, cost, where you bought, when you bought, expiration dates, which box/category the item is in etc. You can also have a small card in each section or box of the kit with the list of items in that specific area. The “Burn” bag/box for example can have a small card that lists the items in that box. Labeling and tracking your materials, especially when you use them, is of course the most important part of this. Making kits for shorter terms like 6-12 months at a time also allows you to look at your inventory on a more regular basis to refresh your stock. Labeling is also important if you have a stranger jump on board to help you with your emergency in finding what is needed quickly.  </p>

                <div class="paraStory">
                <p>You should always have the full medical information of your crew members easy to access for yourself as well as any stranger who may have jumped on board to help during an emergency. Similarly, when something happens, there should be a per-designated way for someone to record and track what happens so the information can be relayed to first responders who will eventually come onto the scene. This could be as simple as having a piece of paper on a clipboard with a pen attached readily available near the nav station. We've made some examples you can use and are free to download below.  </p>

                <div class="paraTitle">Beware of Medications</div>
                <div class="paraStory">
                <p>It is very common for med kits to come with medications. A big responsibility is to make sure none of them are expired. Antibiotics come with a special unforeseen danger. When setting out, well meaning physicians will sometimes hand out prescriptions for the “common” antibiotics that treat the most common infections such as strep throat or ear infections. The problem when non-medical sailors get sick that every ear infection or UTI is not the same bug necessarily or every stomachache doesn't have the same cause. It is important to get yourself stabilized using your med kit, with the use of medications for fever and pain for example, and get yourself to a medical professional as soon as possible so that they may assess the exact antibiotic you need. For chronic illnesses, it is especially important to have good insight into your disease and to have appropriate medications for it. Build your kit with the meds you need and know how to use and go to a doctor for the rest in the nearest country. A final point on medications is that you should check with the countries you are visiting whether all the medications you are carrying on board are legal in that country.  </p>
